# TO DO LIST (Will remove once done.)
# [x] 1. Ask user for search input
# [x] 2. If user enters 'done' then end program
# [ ] 3. If user enters nothing, tell them no input was received and prompt for input. Remind them that done will exit the app.
# [ ] 4. If user enters something: 
#    [x] a. Print the header row to the new result file.
#    [ ] b. Search for user input in the csv.
#       [ ] i. If search input found in current row, add row to the new result file.
#       [ ] ii. Else skip the row.
