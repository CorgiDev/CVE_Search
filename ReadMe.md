# Project Title
Brief description here. This program pulls down a list of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) from https://cve.mitre.org/data/downloads/, and then imports it into a dictionary that can be searched.

## Pre-requisites
List of pre-requisites for running the program:
1. Download the allitems.csv file from https://cve.mitre.org/data/downloads/allitems.csv.
   1. If the link does not work, you can go to https://cve.mitre.org/data/downloads/ and just select the **allitems.csv** file listed there.
   
2. Put the file in the root of the project so that it is in the same folder as the **filePrep.py** file.
3. c

## How to Launch Project
List of steps to run the program:
1. Navigate to the root folder of the project. You should see the main.py file.
2. Run the following command: </br> `py main.py install`
   1. If that doesn't work you may need to try: </br> `C:\Python38\python.exe main.py install`
   1. There is a change you will have a different version of Python installed. If you go to your C: drive, you should see a folder named `python##`. Just swap out the pound signs (#) for what your folder has at the end.
1. Then run the above command again, but without `install`. 
   1.  So the command would be: </br> `py main.py`
   2.  Or, as before, if that does not work, you can try: </br> `C:\Python##\python.exe main.py`
2. If the program is run multiple times for different results. If the **CVE_Downloads** folder is present when the program is startedm it will delete it to ensure you get the most updated set of data to search.

## Possible project ideas
1. CVE page
   1. Downloads csv file from external source.
   2. Reads the file, edits it to prepare to pull it in.
   3. Converts the edited contents into a dictionary/list.
   4. Add 3 functions.
      1. One that edits the file.
2. b
3. c

## Project Requirements according to syllabus

I'll delete this section once I get my project completed.

### **Requirements:**
Choose a **minimum of 3** of the below features and incorporate into your site
- [] Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
- [] Create a class, then create at least one object of that class and populate it with data
- [x] Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
- [] Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file
- [x] Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application
- [x] Create and call at least 3 functions, at least one of which must return a value that is used
- [] Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format
- [] Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app
- [] Create 3 or more unit tests for your application
- [] Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (ex: converts cups to grams)
- [] Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
- [] Analyze text and display information about it (ex: how many words in a paragraph)
- [] Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data
- [] Other features can be added to this list - just ask if your project needs something specific and as long as it’s a good demonstration of your programming skills, it almost certainly will count!  Basically, we just want to see you do something interesting and challenging!

### Additional Requirements
**ALL** of the below requirements must be met.
- [] Your code have comments that document major sections of your code to make it easier to read
  - You don’t need to go crazy on this - a few code comments are perfectly fine
- [x] Your project code is uploaded to your GitHub account, in its own repository, **with at least 5 commits**
  - We need to see that you’ve used Git to update your GitHub profile at least 5 times
  - **Using GitHub’s file uploader does not count as a check-in.** You must upload via Git. 
- [x] It must include a README file located at the top level directory of your project that includes:
  - A description of your project
  - What features you chose to included (so we know what to look for)
  - Any special instructions we might need to run your project
